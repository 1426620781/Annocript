<br>
In version 0.2 the software creates a database of protein downloading:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- uniprot Knowledge Base and merging the swiss-prot
and Tremble datasets;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- or Uniref90 and adding the results of Swiss-prot
too.<br>
<br>
All the Annocript has been divided in four main modules:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- the DB creation, that is needed for the creation
of a large database with informations taken from Uniprot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uniref,...etc, about proteins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- the programs execution, that is a script that
permits the executions of the various program that we want to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use (blastx, blastn, portrait,
..etc). Its purpose is to execute programs and store outputs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- the output creation with GFF3 use, this is the
part of Annocript where the programs output is extracted and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inserted in a final output table.
This output can also be converted in GFF3 files and stored with BioPerl;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- the creation of statistics is a script that
extract some files with statistics from the output table and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creates a web page with plots.<br>
<br>
Initially Annocript was given the version 2.0 because of the first
version by Swaraj. In the moment of the publication<br>
Annocript has been given the version 0.2.<br>
<br>
Annocript2.0.1: it uses 3 folders with 3 different execution based on 3
differents config files. Here there's the problem that the output files
have different name with the same files that are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used from another execution as
input.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover the use of 3 file of
configuration is too much heavy for usability of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software.<br>
<br>
Annocript2.0.2: it uses only 1 configuration file and then the first
script is the executor that calls all other scripts and manages their
config hashes. The programs have to save all the file in a folder
data.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For each execution now the
software asks for the folder of user session. This could be existent or
not. It can be created and overwrited.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this version I've also done
some changes to the software to keep it more readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fast in example changing the
database names.<br>
<br>
Annocript2.0.3: I decided to make some changes to the database: the
mapping table will have the id for each enzymeId since I was making two
query each time and the computational time is very expensive. This
is&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;exactly in the step where I build the final table
in GFF3_AND_OUTPUT and the system does<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of queries to find what is
the best between the trembl and sp result.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is how to reduce this
computational time. So I started a new version.<br>
<br>
Annocript2.0.3b: this version is characterized from the different
production of the final table. It was all done by accessing the GFF
database and it was very expensive. The time to create the table only
was 1,5 days.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we decided to use other
mechanisms and finally I designed an hash from where data are taken
instead that make queries. This has been definitively more efficient.
All the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; script for GFF producing and
final table occurs 3-4 hours.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this version has been
established that there will be one only folder for all the data that is
computed by the EXECUTE_PROGRAMS script when the blasts have to access
the databases (created by makeblastdb and the rFam and CCD).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This folder is located in the
main folder of Annocript. (Fri, 07 december 2012)...Annocript is
becoming a monster...<br>
<br>
Annocript2.0.4: this is a version that we were using a lot. It was
almost complete in all the initially designed <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; functionalities and it
contains possibility to compute some statistics on the output files and
creates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also some plots with
R.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All these plots are put in a HTML file with also
the statistics.<br>
<br>
Annocript2.0.5: in this version two additions have been done. The first
is that you can have different files of output <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the BLAST programs. In
this way one can choose to divide the file of transcripts and run them
in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parts on different machines
or processors. Another main addition is that now Annocript can be ran in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background. We used a perl
script that executes&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the configuration and another
script that runs all the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pipeline in background.<br>
<br>
Annocript2.0.6: in this version I used only one configuration hash to
memorize variables. Then with Remo we seen the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; code together and some
adjustement were done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
AnnocriptPub: this is a version wrote for the publication. A lot of IF
has been removed to permit the continue <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; execution of all the
pipeline without too questions to the user. Some other improvements are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to check if a database
exists we used&nbsp; the query 'show database like'; used two log file
to know what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elements of the GOMapping
are not found in the UNIPROT database; the module gff3_utilities has
been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; removed and the functions
to have the ORF file have been put in the gff3_manager module; built the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; functions dlAndExtract to
download and extract a compressed file; for the uncompression of files
has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been now used a native
function of PERL that finds the compression type (subroutine
extract_file);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a new function is also
extract name to extract the name of the file without extension
(extractName);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the two functions similar
to create a NonCoding info file and to know what is the number of non
coding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sequences have been joined
in one only;the query coverage and hit coverage have been added to the
final<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table&nbsp; for both
swiss-prot and trembl results;<br>
<br>
AnnocriptPub2.0.10: in this version we changed the way the mappingTable
is created. The INSERT with the option that if the field is already
present it will be updated was too expensive in computational terms so
we decided to use an hash to build during the reading of the files.
This results in a faster process since there is only one access to the
database. The one to upload the table created thanks to the hahs. We
added the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possibility to use the UNIREF
database.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a new function for the parsing
has been added (createUnirefDB).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Annocript searches for both
an UNIREF and an UNIPROT_KB database and asks what to use.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An error has been corrected in
the output_and_stats module since it was counting the GO occurrences<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple times for the same
sequence annotation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new field has been added to the
final table saying if the sequence is coding or non-coding for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annocript. This is done by
changing the printAllInfo<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subroutine in the module and by
checking the constrains for each of the blastx, rps, blastn outputs and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the longest ORF lenght and the
non coding probability given by portrait.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This resulted also in the
possibility to change completely the function createNCInfoFile that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing all these checks and now
can simply look for the corresponding field to create the file.<br>
<br>
AnnocriptPub2.0.11: in this version I read the code with my supervisor
Remo and we corrected some stuffs in <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output_and_stats.pm: the count of
annotated sequences is done during the building the array of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; results; the non-codingness of a
sequence is computed during the construction of the final output table<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since we need to put a new field
with this flag; the function execute_stats has been modified since it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was using equal pieces of
code:&nbsp; the subroutines extractGOstats, printOutGOStats and
extractCDDstats<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been created to reduce the
amount of code repeated;<br>
<br>
AnnocriptPub2.0.12: in this version we put also the first part of the
print in the LOG file because it was not there <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and can be useful for the user:
functions annoPrint and annoDie have been introduced in the annocript.pl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file for this.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an error in the count
of the enrichments. It has been solved.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this version also have been
extracted some common use functions from the modules and inserted in a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different module called
utilities.pm.<br>
<br>
Annocript 2.0.17: Here Annocript has been corrected after the
alpha-test.<br>
<br>
Annocript 2.0.18: This is a version with some other corrections. Now
Annocript is ready for the beta-test. Annocript has also been presented
to BITS2014 and has been awarded in the best poster competition.<br>
<br>
Annocript 0.2.1: After the beta test some corrections had been done. In
particular we had the problem with the download using LWP and with Head
function to simply access a link and see if it is good. The problem was
of the institute so I decided to insert an alert. Some corrections have
been done in the user guide and little problem came out are all solved.
Another problem we had with the use of the Extract file function that
is having a bad behaviour. The uncompression on slower machines is
often blocked. I decided to write my own function to uncompress the
files. <br>
The problems in this part are mostly coming from the usage of Annocript
on different machines. <br>
<br>
Annocript 0.2.2: We finished to correct the software and on 1th April
2014 I gave a presentation with all the issues had during the beta-test
and Remo and Swaraj gave suggestion to implement a table where one can
write the table if it has been well written or Nothing otherwise.
If&nbsp; it is there, the table will&nbsp; not be built again in a
different Annocript execution.<br>
The second suggestion is to use the CUT command to cut the mapping file
from Uniprot to catch only the GO ids. This should reduce the
computational time<br>
<br>
Annocript 0.2.3: The second Annocript day has been done but the process
stopped at the loading of the database in less powerful systems. It was
an error in system execution with a 'mysqlimport' not taking in account
that the string interpolation was reading '\n' as newline and '\t' as a
tab. In this new version different things are changed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-the table upload in db is did first with DBI, thus
a query to DB, and if this does not work (you can have an error: DBI
error: The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version) a
system call is doing the same job;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-system calls now are did with a set of controls
shown on the PERL reference website to be more<br>
specific;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-tables are not more in the Annocript folder while
they are being generated. Instead they will be in the data/YEAR_MONTH
folder in an apposite TABLE folder;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-the config hash before was saved in the Annocript
folder. Now it will stay in the SESSION/DATA folder and it is passed as
argument to annocript_executor.pl;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-in Annocript folder now compare only few files. Now
folders contain the useful files and script:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - CONFIGURATION: contains
everything regarding the configuration<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - USEFUL: contains the scripts
utilities.pm, utils.pm and rRNA zip file<br>
<br>
Annocript 0.2.4: Annocript till this version was using a lot of memory
to create the mapping table. In this new version we decided to insert a
control and if there is enough memory then Annocript will use a big
hash to store information while indeed it will use queries to access
the database.<br>
In this version also has been completely removed the use of the file
with Counts since a single file is not useful.<br>
