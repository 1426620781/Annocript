# File configuration for The user of Annocript 0.2

# READ CAREFULLY!!!
# This file has been written with a specific sintax. 
# The variables MUST stay in the format: variable = value
# A series of hashes (#########) closes the parameters to read
# Parameters of BLAST programs without a value assigned will not be used
# When you want to execute something you have to write YES (in upper case) or NO otherwise
# other strings will give error.
